# weatherApp
This project is developed using **angular 12** and **ionic 5.9.2**.
To develop the project it is necessary to install nodejs, the installation of node is different in each operating system (see installation documentation).
After doing this you need to install angular.


`npm install -g @angular/cli`

after installing angular it is necessary to install ionic.

` npm install -g @ionic/cli`

After installing ionic I generated the project only with Cordova as Capacitor gives me some problems.

`ionic start tempo tabs --type=angular --cordova`


Within the tabs I have generated folders as you can see from the project.

`ionic g page /folder/nameFolder`

In this project a weather app with different sections is developed. 

**The first:**

represents the home with the various cities of which it is possible to see the forecasts.

**The second:**

in that a map is displayed.

**The third:**

instead allows you to view some users who use the app.


To run project types:

`npm start `
