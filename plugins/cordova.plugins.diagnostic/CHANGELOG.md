    * The recommended Cordova Android platform version is now `cordova-android@9.0.0` (which includes AndroidX support).
        * To use this plugin with `cordova-android@8`, install [cordova-plugin-androidx](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-androidx) and [cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter).
* (iOS) *BREAKING CHANGE:* Remove conditional code to support iOS <= 9

**v5.0.2**

* Enable the `types` parameter for `requestRemoteNotificationsAuthorization` to be omitted (rather than requiring empty object). Fixes [#286](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/286).

**v4.0.3**
* Remove literal angle brackets in comment attributes as they cause XML parse issue in Visual Studio. Fixes [#284](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/284).

**v4.0.2**
* Add `<uses-permission>` manifest entry for Bluetooth since registering broadcast receiver is now done at runtime. Fixes [#282](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/282)/[#283](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/283).

**v4.0.1**
* Register explicit broadcast receivers for location/Bluetooth/NFC state change listeners at run-time, due to [removal of support for implicit broadcast receivers in Android 8.0 (API 26)](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background.html#broadcasts).

* Run all iOS native plugin commands on a background thread (other than those which call methods on `[UIApplication sharedApplication]` so must explicitly run on the main thread) to prevent THREAD WARNING messages in the console.
Fixes [#272](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/272).


**v3.9.1**
* Declare Objective-C constants as static. Fixes [#270](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/270).

**v3.9.0**
* Add `requestRemoteNotificationsAuthorization()` for iOS. Resolves [#269](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/269).
* Add `remoteNotificationType` constants for iOS to enumerate the various notification types when checking with `getRemoteNotificationsAuthorizationStatus()` or requesting with `requestRemoteNotificationsAuthorization()`.
* Minor refactor/code cleanup of native iOS implementation.

**v3.8.1**
* Use `if else` instead of `switch` on CPU arch strings for backward-compatibility to Java 6. [PR #263](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/263). Fixes [#264](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/264). 

**v3.8.0**
* Add `enableDebug()` to Android and iOS which outputs native plugin debug messages to native and JS consoles.
* Add `restart()` to Android which warm/cold restarts the app.
* Add `getArchitecture()` to Android and iOS to return the CPU architecture of the current device.

**v3.7.3**
* Revert "add switchToLocationSettings to iOS" (PR [#223](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/223) / commit 74e1d97939a3f7d3d14424761100d4506b55afa6). Resolves [#262](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/262).

**v3.7.2**
* Fix Android build errors due to stricter checks on WifiManager reference. Fixes [#251](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/251).

**v3.7.1**
* Set Android Support Library version to v26.+. Fixes [#240](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/240) - again!

* Adds `isDataRoamingEnabled()` for Android (thanks to [dukhanov](https://github.com/dukhanov))
* Calls `isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications` on background thread for iOS 11. Fixes [#238](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/238).
* Rewrites Motion Tracking authorization for iOS to fix bugs and edge cases (see [#197](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/197)).
    * Splits `requestAndCheckMotionAuthorization()` into `requestMotionAuthorization()` and `getMotionAuthorizationStatus()`.
        * `getMotionAuthorizationStatus()` returns the current authorization status only and does not request permission if it has not already been requested.
        * `requestMotionAuthorization()` should now only be called once when `motionStatus` is `NOT_REQUESTED`. Calling more than once will invoke the error callback. 
    * Adds `cordova.plugins.diagnostic.motionStatus` constants to full describe authorization states.
    * Deprecates `requestAndCheckMotionAuthorization()`. Calling this will invoke `requestMotionAuthorization()` but also generate a console warning.

**v3.6.7**
* Adds `isRemoteNotificationsEnabled()` for Android (in addition to iOS).
* Adds `getRemoteNotificationsAuthorizationStatus()` for iOS 10+.

**v3.6.6**

**v3.1.0**

**NOTE:** This version contains backwardly-incompatible renaming of some functions. Either fix the version of the plugin in your config.xml to `cordova.plugins.diagnostic@3.0` or update your code to use the revised names below.

- Revised function names to logically separate those which check if device OS setting is enabled (`isSomethingEnabled()`) vs those which check if hardware/sensor is available for use by the app (device OS setting is enabled AND app has authorisation AND hardware is present - `isSomethingAvailable()`).
    - Renamed `isLocationEnabled()` => `isLocationAvailable()` (Android, iOS and Windows 10 Mobile) - if location is available to app
    - Renamed `isLocationEnabledSetting()` => `isLocationEnabled()` (iOS) - if device setting for location is enabled
    - Added `isLocationEnabled()` (Android) - if device setting for location is enabled
    - Renamed `isCameraEnabled()` => `isCameraAvailable()` (Android, iOS and Windows 10 Mobile) - if camera is available to app
    - Renamed `isBluetoothEnabled()` => `isBluetoothAvailable()` (Android, iOS and Windows 10 Mobile) - if Bluetooth is available to app
    - Added `isBluetoothEnabled()` (Android) - if the device setting for Bluetooth is enabled
    - Renamed `isGpsLocationEnabled()` => `isGpsLocationAvailable()` (Android) - if GPS location is available to app
    - Added `isGpsLocationEnabled()` (Android) - if device setting for GPS location is enabled
    - Renamed `isNetworkLocationEnabled()` => `isNetworkLocationAvailable()` (Android) - if network location is available to app
    - Added `isNetworkLocationEnabled()` (Android) - if device setting for network location is enabled

**v3.0.3**

- Fix for [#80](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/80), where change in Location Mode on Android would cause exception if plugin has not been initialised by a call from JS.

**v3.0.2**

- Updated plugin and documentation to explicitly support only Windows 10 Mobile (and not Windows Phone 8.x)

**v3.0.1**

- Fixed Android issues for apps not using Bluetooth state listening

**v3.0.0**

- Added permissions management for Contacts and Calendar to Android & iOS
- Added permissions management for Reminders to iOS
- Enable registration of listeners to be notified of location and Bluetooth state changes on Android and iOS
- Replace string literals returned with constants

*Backward-incompatibility with v2*

In order to make cross-platform use of the shared plugin functions easier, some **backwardly-incompatible changes** have been made to existing API functions.

To avoid breaking existing code which uses the old API syntax, you can continue to use the v2 API by specifying the plugin version when adding it: `cordova.plugins.diagnostic@2`

v3 contains the following backwardly-incompatible changes:

iOS:

- `requestCameraAuthorization()` and `requestMicrophoneAuthorization()`: success callback is now passed a {string} referencing the `permissionStatus` constants instead of a {boolean}

**v2.3.16**

- Update Android variant of camera authorization methods to request CAMERA permission in addition to READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE. This is due to permission changes in cordova-plugin-camera@2.2.0.

**v2.3.15**

- Add checks for Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) and Bluetooth LE Peripheral Mode to Android
- Fix bug causing getMicrophoneAuthorizationStatus() to always return NOT_DETERMINED

**v2.3.14**

- Add support for checking and requesting microphone access to Android and iOS
- Document current quirks with requestCameraAuthorization() on Android.

**v2.3.13**

- Fix erroneous reference to invalidPermissions. Fixes [#42](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/42).
- Document deprecation of registerLocationAuthorizationStatusChangeHandler()

**v2.3.12**

- Simplify the handling of user response to location authorization request on iOS. Fixes [#35](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/35).

**v2.3.11**

- Callback to JS in WebView-agnostic way from iOS native
- Change so only one location permission type is needed more location to be authorized on Android
- Robustify check for UIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString. Fixes [#34](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/34).
- Update docs regarding requestLocationAuthorization on iOS vs Android. Improves [#35](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/35) but doesn't entirely fix it.
- Fixed requestCameraAuthorization returning DENIED_ALWAYS when access is granted on Android

**v2.3.10**

- Update documentation regarding Android API version and legacy API 22 branch

**v2.3.9**

- Ensure plugin methods return boolean true/false (not integer 0/1). Fixes [#28](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/28).

**v2.3.0**

This version updates the plugin to support Android 6 (API 23) [runtime permissions](http://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html).

In order to do this it must depend on libraries only present in API 23+, so you __must build using Android SDK Platform v23 or above__. To do this you must have [Cordova Android platform](https://github.com/apache/cordova-android)@5.0.0 or above installed in your project. You can check the currently installed platform versions with the following command:

    cordova platform ls

Currently the default version installed (if not specified) is cordova-android@4 which uses API 22, so you need to explicitly specify the version when adding the platform:

    cordova platform add android@5.0.0

__Note:__ Attempting to build with API 22 or below will result in a build error.


You __must__ also make sure your build environment has the following Android libraries installed. In a local build environment, you'd install these via the Android SDK Manager:

 -  Android Support Library - Rev. 23 or above
 -  Android Support Repository - Rev. 23 or above
